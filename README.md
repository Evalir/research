> Thinking in code.

This repository contains experimental code related to research for the [vac protocol](https://vac.dev). Some of the proof-of-concepts in this repository may later make it into the protocol as fundamental components.

## Projects

 - [remote log](./remote_log) - Contains a nim mock server representing a [remote log](https://notes.status.im/Rwh-18AdSgKAkhfwfBE-OA).

 - [Whisper Scalability Model](./whisper_scalability) - Theoretical model for bandwidth usage given some assumptions and usage, see [report](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/vacp2p/research/blob/master/whisper_scalability/report.html) and [Discuss post](https://discuss.status.im/t/fixing-whisper-for-great-profit/1419).

 - [zkSNARKs/Semaphore](./zksnarks/semaphore) - Feasability study for zkSnarks and [Semaphore](https://github.com/kobigurk/semaphore) to do anonymous signaling, including [rate limiting](https://ethresear.ch/t/semaphore-rln-rate-limiting-nullifier-for-spam-prevention-in-anonymous-p2p-setting/5009) in p2p networks (not everything in snarks).
