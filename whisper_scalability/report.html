<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:fuchsia;">Whisper theoretical model. Attempts to encode characteristics of it.</span>

Goals:
1. Ensure network scales by being user or usage bound, as opposed to bandwidth growing in proportion to network size.
2. Staying with in a reasonable bandwidth limit for limited data plans.
3. Do the above without materially impacting existing nodes.

<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:fuchsia;">Case 1. Only receiving messages meant for you [naive case]</span>

Assumptions:
- A1. Envelope size (static): 1024kb
- A2. Envelopes / message (static): 10
- A3. Received messages / day (static): 100
- A4. Only receiving messages meant for you.

<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:#3333FF;">For 100 users, receiving bandwidth is 1000.0KB/day</span>
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:#3333FF;">For 10k users, receiving bandwidth is 1000.0KB/day</span>
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:#3333FF;">For  1m users, receiving bandwidth is 1000.0KB/day</span>

------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:fuchsia;">Case 2. Receiving messages for everyone [naive case]</span>

Assumptions:
- A1. Envelope size (static): 1024kb
- A2. Envelopes / message (static): 10
- A3. Received messages / day (static): 100

<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:red;">For 10k users, receiving bandwidth is    9.5GB/day</span>
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:red;">For  1m users, receiving bandwidth is  953.7GB/day</span>

------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:fuchsia;">Case 3. All private messages go over one discovery topic</span>

Assumptions:
- A1. Envelope size (static): 1024kb
- A2. Envelopes / message (static): 10
- A3. Received messages / day (static): 100
- A6. Proportion of private messages (static): 0.5
- A7. Public messages only received by relevant recipients (static).
- A8. All private messages are received by everyone (same topic) (static).

<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:yellow;">For 100 users, receiving bandwidth is   49.3MB/day</span>
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:red;">For 10k users, receiving bandwidth is    4.8GB/day</span>

------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:fuchsia;">Case 4. All private messages are partitioned into shards</span>

Assumptions:
- A1. Envelope size (static): 1024kb
- A2. Envelopes / message (static): 10
- A3. Received messages / day (static): 100
- A6. Proportion of private messages (static): 0.5
- A7. Public messages only received by relevant recipients (static).
- A9. Private messages are partitioned evenly across partition shards (static), n=5000

<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:#3333FF;">For 100 users, receiving bandwidth is 1000.0KB/day</span>
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:#3333FF;">For 10k users, receiving bandwidth is    1.5MB/day</span>
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:red;">For  1m users, receiving bandwidth is   98.1MB/day</span>

------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:fuchsia;">Case 5. Case 4 + All messages are passed through bloom filter with false positive rate</span>

Assumptions:
- A1. Envelope size (static): 1024kb
- A2. Envelopes / message (static): 10
- A3. Received messages / day (static): 100
- A6. Proportion of private messages (static): 0.5
- A7. Public messages only received by relevant recipients (static).
- A9. Private messages are partitioned evenly across partition shards (static), n=5000
- A10. Bloom filter size (m) (static): 512
- A11. Bloom filter hash functions (k) (static): 3
- A12. Bloom filter elements, i.e. topics, (n) (static): 100
- A13. Bloom filter assuming optimal k choice (sensitive to m, n).
- A14. Bloom filter false positive proportion of full traffic, p=0.1

<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:lime;">For 100 users, receiving bandwidth is   10.7MB/day</span>
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:red;">For 10k users, receiving bandwidth is  978.0MB/day</span>
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:red;">For  1m users, receiving bandwidth is   95.5GB/day</span>

NOTE: Traffic extremely sensitive to bloom false positives
This completely dominates network traffic at scale.
With p=1% we get 10k users ~100MB/day and 1m users ~10gb/day)
------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:fuchsia;">Case 6. Case 5 + Benign duplicate receives</span>

- A3. Received messages / day (static): 100
- A6. Proportion of private messages (static): 0.5
- A7. Public messages only received by relevant recipients (static).

<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:red;">For  1m users, receiving bandwidth is  190.9GB/day</span>

------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:fuchsia;">Case 7. Case 6 + Mailserver case under ideal conditions and mostly offline</span>

Assumptions:
- A1. Envelope size (static): 1024kb
- A2. Envelopes / message (static): 10
- A3. Received messages / day (static): 100
- A6. Proportion of private messages (static): 0.5
- A7. Public messages only received by relevant recipients (static).
- A9. Private messages are partitioned evenly across partition shards (static), n=5000
- A10. Bloom filter size (m) (static): 512
- A11. Bloom filter hash functions (k) (static): 3

- A19. Mailserver only fetches topic interested in.

<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:#3333FF;">For 100 users, receiving bandwidth is    3.0MB/day</span>
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:red;">For 10k users, receiving bandwidth is  196.9MB/day</span>
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:red;">For  1m users, receiving bandwidth is   19.2GB/day</span>

------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:fuchsia;">Case 8. Waka mode - no metadata protection with bloom filter and one node connected; still static shard</span>

Next step up is to either only use contact code, or shard more aggressively.
Note that this requires change of other nodes behavior, not just local node.

Assumptions:
- A1. Envelope size (static): 1024kb
- A2. Envelopes / message (static): 10
- A3. Received messages / day (static): 100
- A6. Proportion of private messages (static): 0.5
- A7. Public messages only received by relevant recipients (static).
- A9. Private messages are partitioned evenly across partition shards (static), n=5000

<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:#3333FF;">For 100 users, receiving bandwidth is 1000.0KB/day</span>
<span style="filter: contrast(70%) brightness(190%);color:#3333FF;">For 10k users, receiving bandwidth is    1.5MB/day</span>
