# Hello GossipSub

Playing around with GossipSub in Nim to check feasibility of moving over Waku to libp2p.

Let's start small:
- Node that broadcast message
- Node that receives it


## Running

`nim c -r src/hello_gossipsub.nim`


## What I want to do

Use Waku stuff from Nimbus here,
Get quicksim working
Then try to do similar with libp2p gossipsub
