# Probelm Definition

This document is going to provide a comparison between  Tor and Waku. The ["Waht is Tor"](#what-is-tor) section presents a quick overview of the Tor, and can be skipped for those that are already familiar.  


# What is Tor

As stated in the [Tor specifications](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/tor-spec.txt#n142), Tor is a distributed overlay network designed to anonymize low-latency TCP-based applications such as web browsing, secure shell, and instant messaging. Clients choose a path through the network and build a `circuit`, in which each node (or `onion router `or `OR`) in the path knows its predecessor and successor, but no other nodes in the circuit.  Traffic flowing down the circuit is sent in **fixed-size** `cells`, which are unwrapped by a symmetric key at each node (like the layers of an onion) and relayed downstream. Tor only works for TCP streams and can be used by any application with SOCKS support.

It comes in 3 main steps:
- The Tor client fetches a list of Tor nodes (Onion routers) from a directory server. Onion routers are voluntarily operated servers around the world that are listed publicly in a directory and there is no concern finding out their identity.
- The Tor client picks a random path to the destination server. The path includes three hops. The client negotiates a separate set of encryption keys for each hop along the circuit to ensure that each hop can't trace these connections as they pass through. The message is then encrypted  through **3 layers of encryption**. 
  - For example consider A sending message `M` to B through R1-R3 i.e., A â†’ R3 -> R2 -> R1 -> B, the message `M` is encrypted with 3 keys, in 3 layers as `E(k3, E(k2, E(k1, M)))` where each key is only known to one of the intermediate nodes.
  - Routing nodes only need to know their preceding and exceeding connection, but not the sender of the message. 
  - Once a circuit has been established, many kinds of data can be exchanged and several different sorts of software applications can be deployed over the Tor network.
  - For efficiency, the Tor software uses the same circuit for connections that happen within the same ten minutes or so. Later requests are given a new circuit, to keep people from linking your earlier actions to the new ones.
  - No header is added to the message, otherwise it would be lot easier that how far the message is from its destination. 

- Tor's users employ this network by connecting through a series of **virtual tunnels** rather than making a direct connection, thus allowing both organizations and individuals to share information over public networks without compromising their privacy.
- Tor is the implementation of Onion routing which enables us to communicate anonymously over the internet
- The more people use the Tor network the stronger it gets. As it is easier to hide in a crowd of people that look exactly the same


<!-- Tor Messages are called cells, and are each 512 bytes long 

Routers are talking to many users and as an intermediary for the conversation, like the first node, second nodes, the thrid node, the exit node, and it does not really know which one it is.  So it is a not an easy job to correlate the traffics and figure out what someone did job to
 -->

## Security consideration
Tor is all about **Transport Security** and there is no anonymity gaurantee about the data that is sent by the user over Tor e.g., an attacker may eavesdrop the last connection in thr Tor circuit to the destination server, and sees someone's username and password in clear. It is up to the user to use TLS or HTTPS for the connection. What is transported is exactly a https request and reply that goes through Tor instead of the ISP router.


## security features
Below is the the list of  the security features that Tor provides, however, the essence of all these features are two things:
1. Tor hides (or make it difficult to know) the two end of communication i.e., who is talking to whom
2. It preserves meta data protection that include 
   - Users Real identity
   - Precise location 
   - OS
   - The browser used to surf the web
This means, to make a fair comparison with waku, we need to know whether we can achieve these two major features or not and how.

Further on the features of the Tor:
- Protects against Traffic analysis by concealing headers of Internet data packets: How does traffic analysis work? Internet data packets have two parts: a data payload and a header used for routing. The data payload is whatever is being sent, whether that's an email message, a web page, or an audio file. Even if you encrypt the data payload of your communications, traffic analysis still reveals a great deal about what you're doing and, possibly, what you're saying. That's because it focuses on the header, which discloses source, destination, size, timing, and so on.

Protecting against traffic analysis results means no one knows who you are talking to. This means:
- **BROWSE FREELY** Tor is a censorship circumvention tool, allowing its users to reach otherwise blocked destinations or content. One reason for that is the pool of volunteer-run servers known as Tor relays.
- **DEFEND AGAINST SURVEILLANCE** Tor Browser prevents someone watching your connection from **knowing what websites you visit.** All anyone monitoring your browsing habits can see is that you're using Tor.
-  **MULTI-LAYERED ENCRYPTION**: The traffic is relayed and encrypted three times as it passes over the Tor network. The network is comprised of thousands of volunteer-run servers known as Tor relays. Though, this is not exactly for the confidentiallity but more for the anonymity. The final data that is passed to the final destination may still be unencrypted and compromised privacy. 
- **BLOCK TRACKERS** Tor Browser isolates each website you visit so third-party trackers and **ads can't follow you**. Any **cookies automatically clear** when you're done browsing. Cannot compare this part with waku as I am not sure about the low level details of performing advertising in waku.
- **RESIST FINGERPRINTING** Tor Browser aims to make all users look the same, making it **difficult** for you to be fingerprinted based on **your** **browser** and **device information**.



## Security Vulnerabilities
<!-- The tor network does load sharing: to protect against DoS attack. To load a single router and anyone talking to that router will have a problem.The circuits are restablished about every 10 minutes
It is adaptive and can take a different tour


What if some of the third parties are controlling these nodes:
Maybe government agencies want to know what is going on
They control these nodes with the hope that they eventually control A and B
That is why they are called the guard nodes, because you trust them and you don't pick them randomly
 -->

- If the adversary is the front node and the exit node on the circuit, then it can figure out what is going on. 

- End to end timing attack: Tor does not provide protection against end-to-end timing attacks: If your attacker can watch the traffic coming out of your computer, and also the traffic arriving at your chosen destination, he can use statistical analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit.

- Traffic analysis: imagine you have got the time signature of the messages sent by a single client. The incomming ttraffic to the destination server will be a mess of lots of messages. But imagine that you can find the key points that match up with what the client sent in. Then it can be used to deanonymize that client.
  
## Performance Concerns

Tor routers may be distant and you may get delay till your message get to the destination. 
- [ ] An empirical analysis of this is needed to make a fair comparison with waku.

# Anonymity levels
Anonymity can be analyzed in various levels. Below is a broad classification of such: 
- Communication anonymity against a third person, in this anonymity level, the communication must stay anonymous in the eyes of a third person. Neverthelss, the sender and receiver may know each other and have no concern in this regard.
- Sender anonymity (against the network and the receiver):  For example when you want to hide the fact you are visiting a website
<!-- You need to use **protocol-specific support software** if you don't want the sites you visit to see your identifying information. This exists in Tor browser, For example, you can use Tor Browser while browsing the web to withhold some information about your computer's configuration. -->
- Receiver anonymity, where there is a publisher  with public identity lets say broadcasting political news, and the subscribers want to hide their interest in that topic yet be able to have access to the news

In the following, the focus will be providing anonymity against a third party as the base line. The other two levels

<!-- # Attack types -->
<!-- Targeted attacks, when the attacker is interested in the communication of two specific nodes -->
# Waku
In waku, the relay protocol constitutes the transport layer. The objective would be to protect anonymity in this layer isolated from other available protocols. That is, we rule out the anonymity concerns related to the filter or store protocols. As in those protocols, some level of trust is expected between the two participating peers as the service provider and the consumer. Further on the anonymity and trust requirement of the store and the filter protocol can be found in their respective specs. 

In the following, I am considering nodes with relay protocol mounted and involve both as relayer and as publisher. 
- [ ] Later, we can extend the security analysis for other types of the nodes like light nodes and also consider inclusion of other protocols.

**Transported Data**
One source of information for the attacker in breaking anonymity is the metadata that is included inside the transported data. Such information can be included to aid the transportation or can be some application level information that are in clear. The presence of any personally identifiable information can help the attacker identify the sender and the receiver of the message. 

Lets first have a look at the structure of waku messages and the headers used while transporting them using GossipSub protocol (i.e., Waku-Relay. 
A waku message contains: 
- Payload which can be encrypted
- ContentTopic
- Version
- Timestamp
The waku message then resides inside the `data` field of a pubsub message with the following fields
- data
- topic
- seq#
- from
- sign
- key


## No Sign Policy
In order to preserve anonymity, the relay-protocol follow strict no sign policy which means the `seq#`, `from`, `sign` and `key` fields are omitted as they indicate info related to the sender of the message.

- [ ] The use of IP addresses in the GossipSub protocol is not clear to me, I need to make sure that the sender's IP of the sender does not get shared/used during the routing process.

## Payload Encryption
The payload field contains the content of the message either in clear or encrypted. Having it encrypted has twow benfitis, one is data confidentiality and the other is that it prevents unintentional disclosure of personally identifiable information e.g., the payload may contain the sender's email address. 


## Topic anonymity
There are two another field of  `topic` used in GossipSub routing which can cause anonymity issues. 
The use of `topic` is an application layer concern and not directly related to the waku protocol stack. However, a solution on how to treat and utilise this field securely is the key to anonymity and is worth of investigation. 

Currently, the `topic` field is used to connect the two ends of  a communication i.e., the publishers and the subscribers find each other through pubsub topics. Also, AFAIK, the Status app relies on the pubsub topics to distinguish between different 1:1 or group chats. That is each 1:1 chat is associated with a distinct chat id used as the pubsub topic. Having unique pubsub topics enables the attacker to spot the sender and the receiver. How?   Lets say an attacker eavesdrops the network traffic of two targeted nodes and realises that they are actively relaying messages of the pubsub topic X, then it can infer they are communicating which each other. 

The general rule is that when a node is part of a topic mesh then he is the (potential) receiver of messages of that topic/ Hence if a topic indicate a group of communicating nodes, then breaking the anonymity can be done by identifying the nodes within the same mesh. This info is not secret and is somewhat publicly available.

### Topic sharding
Topic sharding is to blend multiple group of communicating participants into one i.e., mixing multiple meshes into one. As such, instead of having one shard for each topic lets say K1 ... KN, all of them will be in the same shard hence relayed withing one single mesh. then the relay nodes in K1 are indistinguishable from K2 and... KN. This is also known as K-anonymity when a group of k users look identical w.r.t. some attributes.
Another way to look at topic sharding is that nodes from otherwise distinct meshes  aid relaying topics of other meshes. 
 <!-- in order to confuse the attacker and make the topics less specific. -->

- [ ] Is this level of a anonymity sufficient? How does it compare to the Tor? It depends on the deployed sharding algorithm as well as the adversary background knowledge. A concrete answer requires an study on k-anonymity techniques and their security analysis.
 
<!-- This means in order to preserve anonymity we need to hide the relation between the topics and their publishers and subscribers i.e., to preserve publisher-topic anonymity and subscriber-topic anonymity. -->
<!-- However, consider the case that we use distinct pubsub topics for each 1:1 or private group chats. For those specific pubsub topics, there will be a limited number of relay nodes subscribed to that pubsub topic hence identifying them would be easy. Moreover, that would be easy to find out whether there is an active conversation between two parties. Lets say if an attacker eavesdrops the network traffic of two victim nodes and realises that they are actively relaying messages of pubsub topic X, then it can infer they are communicating which each other.  -->

<!-- 
- If your attacker can watch the traffic coming out of your computer, and also the traffic arriving at your chosen destination, he can use statistical analysis to discover that they are part of the same circuit. -->


<!-- In waku there are two ways to spot the two ends of communication:
- Via Publishing: If Alice and Bob both publish to the same topic
- Via joining the topic mesh: If Alice and Bob are both part of the same topic mesh
   -->

The act of publishing to a topic is theoretically protected and is anonymous, That is by hijacking a link and getting to see message m is set from node A to B, cannot jusge the author of the message. Nevertheless, a more powerful adversary can analyze the delay  by which the message arrives at other nodes of the netwrok. The one with minimum delay is potentially the owner of the message. 
For example in the chanin of nodes A->B->C->D, if A publishes and owns a messages, then B is the first one the receives it and D is the last one. Such time difference can help identifying the owner of the message. Likewise, the other part of the communocation can be spot. Hence, the anonymity gets violated.


## Growing the mesh with random volunteered relay nodes
One way to preserve anonymity is to encourage more nodes to participate in relaying random pubsub topics i.e., topics that might not be of their interest. This way the true participants of the mesh will get mixed with the volunteer ones and will enjoy a higher level of anonymity. However, it comes with the cost of bandwidth for the volunteered relay nodes.
<!-- It is somewhat similar to what Tor requires, it says that the more Tor realyers would result in better anonymity. As such, I suggest to use waku content topic to manage direct or group messaging.  -->

## Single global pubsub topic
The ultimate and the maximum anonymity level that can be achieved by topic sharding is when all the topics are shared into one single topic i.e., all the nodes relay all the topics. As the result, being a relay node of that single topic conveys no useful information about the true interest of the relayer. However, this approach might be inefficient and costly for all the relayers.

### The use of Content Topic for group management
In case of using one single pubsub topic, we can distinguish different communication groups e.g., 1:1 and group chats through waku content topics.
This may sound like getting back to the same set of security issues as when pubsub topic is used for the same purpose, however, it is not the case. 
- Being a relay node does not mean being the receiver of all the content topics published on that pubsub topic. Indeed, we are decoupling the routing from the group management layer. 
- The receiver of the message remains anonymous as long as it does not publish a message with a similar content topic. This is not the case when pubsub topics are used to signify group ids.
#### Asymmetric content topics
Now, to provide anonymity we need to find a way to hide the link between a publisher and his content topic.
Lets take a different perspective, instead of hiding who is publishing to which content topic, lets focus on making the content topics look different from the sender to the receiver i.e., using asymmetric content topics. For example, Alice uses content topic `A` to send message to Bob whereas Bob replies to Alice using content topic `B`. In this example, both Alice and Bob know that they should expect and listen to content topics `B` and `A`, respectively.  
- [ ] This is just a proposal, but a concrete solution on such asymmetrical topic generation needs more research. Just for the intuition, you can think of the double ratchet algorithm and how it yields unique message key per send and receive. The message keys can be used as the content topic in the waku messaging scenario.


# Waku advantages over the Tor
One potential advantage of using waku is that it is computationally lighter than Tor and does not require multiple encryption and decryption. This would also lower the message transmission delay.

Another advantage is the lighter key management where  the sender does not have to establish shared keys with all the intermediate routers (as apposed to the Tor).

<!-- No **end-to-end timing attack**: Waku is not prone to e2e timing attack as there is no destination in waku if topics are used deliberately and wisely. In waku, the traffic pattern at all the relay nodes that are subscribed to the same topic is identical.  -->
<!-- However, we should be aware of the fact that the number of messages that a sender sends will be evident which I believe is the same in Tor.  -->
